	<h2>Screenshot of Sandbox Admin panel:</h2>

	<aside class="corner wide top-right">
		<p>I was all set to make a full mock-up of the admin panel, but then I realized that I have a sample of what it will look like already, in the sandbox task control panel. This will be pretty much exactly the same, differing only in the details (what options appear on the side, columns in the tracker, CSVs to be downloaded)</p>

	<aside class="corner wide bottom-right">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Status Display</b>: Add input & exit codes for tracking purposes</li>
			<li><b>Data Download</b>: Pretty much as shown</li>
			<li>
				<b>Options</b>:
				<ul>
					<li><b>System</b>: This will include the slugs for the consent forms, IDs for the LEXTALE and demographics forms, and anything else system-wide I think of.</li>
					<li><b>Blocking</b>: Same structure as in the screenshot, but with the blocks of this study (silent, practice, etc.). The IAT will be separated from the test blocks.</li>
					<li><b>Trial</b>: ISI, study presentation time, Delay before abandoning a trial, Colours used in Implicit test.</li>
